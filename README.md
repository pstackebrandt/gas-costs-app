# Gas Costs App

## Overview

This is a small personal training project for working with React.

The Gas Costs App is a React application designed to help users calculate and track their gas expenses. This app allows users to input their vehicle's fuel efficiency, the distance they plan to travel, and the current gas price to estimate the total cost of their trip.

## Features

- **Fuel Efficiency Input**: Users can enter their vehicle's miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km).
- **Distance Input**: Users can input the distance of their trip in miles or kilometers.
- **Gas Price Input**: Users can enter the current price of gas per gallon or liter.
- **Cost Calculation**: The app calculates the total cost of the trip based on the inputs provided.
- **History Tracking**: Users can save and view their past calculations.
